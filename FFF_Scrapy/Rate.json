Not a bad brew at all I must say, but nothing outstanding either.  If you like Heineken then you\u2019ll easily like this brew as well.

It\u2019s a bitter tasting beer; for me it was almost too bitter (but that\u2019s just me).  Flavors detected consisted of the traditional grains, malts and hops; but I just could not find a happy balance between them; but the grassy flavor was very appearant and somewhat overbearing.  It\u2019s very light on the pallet and a brew that can be a good session beer; especially on those hot summer days. ", "0,5l can, TESCO. As i saw, its alcohol content is 5%.
